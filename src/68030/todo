- address_register_indirect_with_postincrement_mode
- dubious because of signed + unsigned operation, registers are signed if negative flag is set? address_register_indirect_with_displacement_mode
- 

- NOP
- call TRAP at privilege violation exception
- implement STOP
- signal()
- memory access bounds checking
- addressing modes, implement suppression bits for modes requiring it
- addressing modes, with PC read only in program space? program space = program counter
- addressing modes, cast slword to lword at read mem operation?
